Probably not the most efficient way to send messages on Telegram, but definately the most fun.
To use my service it is *required to have a username set in your Telegram account*. If you don't have one, you can set it in the settings.
Here are some commands you can use:
/addfriend <username> - Tell your friend to do the same with your username, boom, you're friends!
/send <username> <message> - Send a message to your friend (who knows if they'll ever get it)
/friends - List all __your__ _friends_
/msgs - List all your *messages*
/help - Show this message
